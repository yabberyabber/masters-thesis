# Funqual - User defined static call tree constraints in C++

This is the repository that hosts my masters thesis where I develop funqual.  The only file that is likely of interest here is main.pdf - the rest of it is the LaTeX source used to generate it.

If you're looking for the funqual tool, you can find it here: https://github.com/yabberyabber/funqual
